# Udacity-EDA-draft
Exploratory Data Analysis project for Udacity DA Nanodegree

###DISCLAIMER!
I am testing git and GitHub for the first time so this may be a bit disorganised.


The files for my Udacity EDA project submission are as follows.

* The project RMD file for knitting is project/R/Liquor_Sales.Rmd
* The project html file is project/R/Liquor_Sales.html
* The scripts read by the .Rmd are in project/R/
  * data_load_main.R
  * data_load_aux.R
  * data_merge.R
* The saved workspace that needs to be loaded in for knitting is project/project.RData
* The downloaded and auxilliary datasets can be found in my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/osdbg8o1j28cp1l/EDA_Udacity_data.zip?dl=0)
* A fairly disorganised iPython Notebook with my data scraping/API requests for auxilliary data can be found in project/python/Untitled.ipynb
