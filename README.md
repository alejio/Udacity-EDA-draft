###DISCLAIMER!
I am testing git and GitHub for the first time so this may be a bit disorganised.

Previously I had been working in RStudio by editing a few scripts locally.

But it is clearly a good idea to start learning about version control while I'm at it - 
and it's awesome to be part of this community.

So far I've installed git and committed most of the  scripts I've worked on so far.

I've tried to organise my scripts logically but this might end up changing.
